## Important Notes

- **The Thief**: He wanders the map and can steal treasures from you. Deposit items in the trophy case frequently to protect your score.
- **The Egg**: Opening it yourself with force destroys the contents. Let the thief open it, or use his tools after defeating him.
- **Point Timing**: Most treasure points are awarded when placing items in the trophy case, not when picking them up.
- **Combat**: Fighting before you're well-equipped can result in death. The sword glows blue when enemies are near.
